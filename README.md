**NEEDL:**  A simple multikey password generator / manager - all from a photo

**CREATED:**  2018

**UPDATED:**  03/27/2024

**VERSION:**  0.1.1b

**ABOUT:**  Using two simple passkeys and the photo filename to generate a hashing salt, Needl creates three unique hashes. One for the x axis, one for the y axis, and one as a modififer. 
Think of a photo as a large two dimensional map of pixels. Needl navigates through that map using coordinates that only your unique hashes can generate. 
Using the pixels at those unique coordinates, Needl calculates its own unique passkey signature. 
Now anytime you need to retrieve that passkey, you just need that photo, and your two passkeys.  
**_Example:_**  
1. Photo00179.jpg (this string itself is a part of salt string)  
2. passkey1:  "First hike with puppy"  (each of these passkeys are salted as well)  
3. passkey2:  "personal instagram"

Only this unique map of pixels, and three unique keys:  passkey1, passkey2, and filename (with datetime options for additional unique salting) 
will retrieve that same unique passkey signature. Use the same combination but a different string for passkey2, for example - "work instagram", 
you will get a completely different and unique passkey signature. 
Like finding a needle in a haystack.

**NOTES:**  Considering making all methods private and a single public async method that returns the needl string in a promise

**TODO:**  Validation of input arguements (image size min requirements, passkey min requirements, filename min requirements) 
check for options argument object and set options accordingly (including datetime for salting) 
add encoding methods

##Documentation

Create and store in a variable a new instance of Needl class. 
The constructor takes an image `<img>`, filename (string), passkey1 (string), 
and passkey2 (string) â€” as well as optional _options_ stored as a collection
 of key-value pairs. *See below for examples.*  
**New instance construction example:**  `let ndl = new Needl(img, fn, pk1, pk2);`

Needl uses JavaScript's SubtleDigest to create the hashes it uses. 
This is an asynchronous function that returns a `Promise`. 
JavaScript class constructors cannot return a `Promise`, 
therefore it's best to handle generating these hashes the first time the 
secret passkey signature (nicknamed *"needl"*) value is requested by calling it's 
getter method `ndl.needl`. This returns a `Promise` that resolves to the 
passkey signature (string).
